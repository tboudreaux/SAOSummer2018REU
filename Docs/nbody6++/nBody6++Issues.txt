Current Issues, Goals, and Questions:
-------------------------------------

1) Can't get two plummer model cluster.
    Input File as follows:
        1 1000000.0 1.E6 40 40 40
        2000 1 10 452 100 1 10
        0.02 0.02 0.3 1.0 1.0 1000.0 2.0E-03 1.0 0.7
        0 1 1 0 2 0 4 3 0 2 # Note KZ(5) set 2
        0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 3 6
        1 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 2
        1 0 2 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
        1.0E-04 1E-3 0.1 1.0 1.0E-06 0.01 0.25
        2.35 100.0 0.08 500 30 0.001 0 1.0
        100.0 0 2000 0.5    # extra line added b/c KZ(5) set 2
        0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0
        2.E-4 -1.0 1.0 1.E3 5 0 
        1.E-5 -1.0 1.0 5.0 0

    Symptoms:
        - Nbody6++GPU inatalizes with no obvious issues
        - Will run seamingly with no end (have let run for 10 hours)
        - No snapshots are written out
        - Most files that do get written are empty
        - Does not respond to STOP file placed in directory
        - job must be killed 
        - One File (nbflow.41) has huge amounts of info dumped into it. 
            - over one hour it balloned to 4 GB of text data
                - Every line was: 
                OVERFLOW! I    1001  NBNEW  4030  RNB[NB]**********  RI[NB]   42.3787

2) Start working towrds a ``main'' simulation
    - Figure out what parameters we are interested in for this simulation
    - Figure out how to format the input file such that it matches the desired initial conditions

3) Cluster
    - Run nBody6++GPU on cluster

4) Confirm KW parameter in snapshots
    - Pretty sure that is giving the stellar type (0 : Low Main Sequence, 1 : Main Sequence, 2 : Hertzsprung gap (HG), and more (for more see Manual Page 39))

5) Times listed in different formats in global.# files don't seam to be consistant with one and other [RESOLVED]
    - Time[NB} alwats increases at the same rate
    - Time listed in the parrallel Time[Myr] column seams to jump around 
    - See the file names "screenshots/time_problem.png" on the googel drive for an example of this

6) Cannot read conf files
    - They are presented as "unformatde binary data" however it is unclear how to parse the data, i.e. what bytes encode what information. I cannot think of a way to determine with without some clue as to how the file is written

7) Cannot get an external particle distribution file to read in, even one what was written out in a previous run

8) initial conditions of particle distribution function do not match the N values set in input file
    - for the N2k sample the system initalized with ~2500 particles, if I change N to 1000 it initalized with around ~1500 particles
    - The code will not run with N=100
        - Presumably this is because N=100 conflicts with some other settings somewhere in the input file; I don't currently undsterstand the interdepencancies between input parameters well enough to speak to this point.

9) Understand exit conditions
    - A simulation will exit without providing feedback, investigating the diagnosis file will show a line "CALCULATIONS HALTED * * *" however it is not clear here what exit condition was reached. That information seams important.

10) Issues for disscussion on Friday
    I) Getting external Mass files read in
        i) 10000_B3_King.txt loads with N10k.input file (drive)
            a) This is in physical units KZ(22) = 10
            b) might want to increase neightbor number
            c) turn off primordial binaries KZ(8) = 0
            d) Turn on KZ(16) = 1
                i) KS regularization to help conserve energy
            e) Turn on KZ(17) = 1
                i) Adjust ETAI time step size
            f) Turn off KZ(23) = 0
                i) Turn off esaping particles, it conflicts with stellar evoluton (if stellar evolution is turned on turn off escapers)
            g) Turn off KZ(35)
                i) Resets time every TTOT = TIME + TOFF if it is on, turn it off to avoid this behavior
            h) Set KZ(46) = 3
                i) output all particles not just active particle list
            i) make data.F parameters consitent with those output from McLuster (max body mass, etc...)

            j) In general check McLuster output for nbody6++ input

            k) check what Nbody6 is going when RTIDE = 0 (scale.F)
        ii) One snapshot is output
        iii) program hangs unresponsive to STOP file introduction
    II) Using McLuster to generate valid input files for nbody6++GPU
    III) Reading conf files
        a) dont bother with this, pull out that information from log file
            i) lines starting with CLUSTER
    IV) Best output practices
    V) Others?

More Issues (Many Potential Related):
    - Got the simulation to run and not hang (on time scales that I have been able to run it for, so far a max of 2 hours)

    - Working on getting cluster params to write out to cluster_status.csv file

    - What are the differences between step #s

    - Simulations are stoping at 100 snapshots pretty much no matter what (sorted this out)

    - Exit condition being hit but I don’t know why they are being hit (writing TOTAL CPU = ***)

    - nbflow seams to be an issue

    - Can’t get code to run for more than 100 snapshots, this has yet to get about 300 Myr (sorted all of this out TCRIT was the problem)

    - Make the random number seeds in the input file the same between runs

    - Binary0-5 won’t get past 17 snapshots, but its is not hanging (can stop by introducing STOP file) but is not writing anything to files (ran for 45 minutes like that before I stoped it)

    - Mydump error was resolved by stoping check.f from calling my dump, seams like an incredibly stupid way to fix things but I think all that is is debug info, so stopping it from writing out in that place should not matter?

Energy Error:
    - If I try and restart after the energy error happens the program crashes (KZ(2)=2 to restart, KZ(2)=1 to end when the energy error arises)

    - By changing the energy tolerance (QE) this problem seams to be mitigable, at least in the short term? (went from 2e-5 to 2e-3)
