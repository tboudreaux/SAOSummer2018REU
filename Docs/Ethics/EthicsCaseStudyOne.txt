Case Study Setup:

Author Attribution

Question:
    A professor is working on a research project. You volunteer to help with the research. All of your work is purely voluntary and you receive no compensation for it. When the professor publishes the results of the research, he doesnâ€™t list you as a co-author, but mentions you in the acknowledgements section of the paper. You feel that you did a substantial amount of work but when you approach the professor he/she does not agree.

Disscussion Questions:
    1) How much work constitutes co-authorship?
    2) Should you drop the issue or bring it to the head of the department?
    3) What if the student was an official and/or paid member of the research group? Would that change the issue?
    4) What could the student have done prior to beginning the research to have avoided this situation?

Extra Questions:
    1) What about the opposite situation, where someone, perhapse a student, has worked on a project, but only in a very limited capacity, and they are offered co authorship on a paper. Would it be ethical for them to accept? Does the answer depend in any way on what stage in their career they are in?
